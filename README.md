# React Redux CRUD App

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using React, Redux. It allows users to manage a list of users and perform CRUD operations on them using Redux Toolkit. The app also integrates with a joke API to display a random joke on the home page. Additionally, Redux Toolkit is used to manage the theme color and username for a personalized user experience. The project utilizes React Redux Toolkit for efficient Redux state management, Bootstrap for styling, Axios for making API requests, and Axios Query for data fetching and caching.
